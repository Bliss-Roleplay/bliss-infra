- name: Add authorized public key
  authorized_key:
    user: "{{ remote_username }}" # required. The username on the remote host whose authorized_keys file will be modified.
    key: "{{ hostvars['localhost']['ansible_ssh_key'] }}" # required. The SSH public key(s), as a string or (since Ansible 1.9) url (https://github.com/username.keys).
    manage_dir: True # not required. Whether this module should manage the directory of the authorized key file. If set to C(yes), the module will create the directory, as well as set the owner and permissions of an existing directory. Be sure to set C(manage_dir=no) if you are using an alternate directory for authorized_keys, as set with C(path), since you could lock yourself out of SSH access. See the example below.
    state: absent # not required. choices: absent;present. Whether the given key (with the given key_options) should or should not be in the file.
